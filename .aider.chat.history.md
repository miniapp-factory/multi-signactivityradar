App Name: Multi-Sign Activity Radar

Description:
Multi-Sign Activity Radar is a Mini App that monitors multisig (multi-signature) contract activity across chains. Detect signature proposals, execution events, and pending multisig transactions to follow governance or treasury actions in near real time.

Key Features:
 • Discovery and tracking of multisig proposals and executions
 • Alerts for newly proposed transactions, quorum changes, and executions
 • Visibility into pending multisig operations and required signers
 • Historical log of multisig activity and execution latency
 • Dashboard to monitor multisigs by project, chain, or purpose

Use Case:
Perfect for DAO members, auditors, and token holders who need visibility into multisig governance/treasury operations and want to respond quickly to proposed spendings or protocol changes.
```

The changes you need to make are in the following files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` constants to match the new app information.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create this new file to describe the logo that should be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized radar icon with concentric circles and a central point, representing a multi-signature activity radar. The background should be a deep navy blue gradient, with the radar icon in bright teal and white accents. The icon should depict a circular radar sweep line moving clockwise, with small dots indicating detected signals. The overall design should convey real-time monitoring and data visualization, suitable for a blockchain governance dashboard.
